      <p>Hi! I'm Shaelyn Albrecht. Currently, I'm a junior at the University of Michigan, where I twirl with the Michigan Marching Band. I've been twirling my whole life, and baton is essentially what shaped me into the person I am today.</p>

      <p>Baton twirling is a hidden gem, a secret sport that the majority of people are only familiar with because of the movie Miss Congeniality. I, on the other hand, have never known life without twirling. My mother, a twirler her whole life, began coaching her own team (called Limited Edition) over twenty-five years ago – I’ve been attending practices and competitions since before I was born. I feel unbelievably lucky that I was born into a family where this unique sport is so central to our identity!</p>

      <p>Before you get too bored reading about me, here's a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyrhb5kxW1k"> video of me twirling </a> </p>

      <p>I grew up competing in WTA, as well as NBTA and TU. I competed individually and with my mom's team. From the time I was 10, I was competing at the advanced level. However, it took me a while to figure out how to practice in a way that was meaningful and would help me perform better. When I competed, I tended to drop at least several times in a routine. Once I started practicing multiple full-run-throughs of my routines every day, things changed and I became more consistent. It's so important to practice as though you're performing, which is also why I always practiced with a smile. It makes it so much easier when you're actually performing because then you don't have to change the way you're thinking.</p>

      <p>When I was 16, my first year in the Senior division, I won Miss Majorette of America. Winning this title had always been a dream of mine; it was a surreal moment and still feels like a dream to this day.</p>

      <p>Being Miss Majorette of America opened a lot of doors for me as far as future competitions and with getting to twirl in college. After my first year twirling with the University of Michigan, I won the Collegiate National Twirling Championships, and I'm so proud to have represented my school while doing what I love!</p>

      <p>I've also had the honor of being on Team USA two times to compete in the Grand Prix competition, which is the first combined world competition between NBTA and USTA; a first step towards one day being in the Olympics.</p>

      <p>Now, I'm no longer competing, but I'm still very involved with baton. I still twirl with the band at Michigan, and I also coach! I frequently go home to my mom's team's practices to help out and teach individual lessons to some of her students. I hope to continue to give back to my sport and one day become a judge and continue teaching my mom's team!</p>
