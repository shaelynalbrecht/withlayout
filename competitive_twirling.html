      <p> Baton twirling competitions are all-day events, much like a gymnastics meet or a dance competition. There are individual events and team events that you can compete in. Many twirlers will compete in both, training with a team while also working on solo events. Competitions typically take place in a gymnasium, like a high school basketball gym. Gym floors are the best surface for spinning, and gyms with high ceilings are best so that twirlers can throw their batons high enough. For individual events, twirlers compete for a judge or a set of judges seated at a table in front of them. Tables usually go down the center of the gym, and twirlers twirl in "lanes" for their division. So, there will be many twirlers (usually between 6-10) competing at the same time for different categories.</p>
      <h2>Levels and Age Divisions</h2>
      <p>Twirlers are divided by level and age. The levels are Novice, Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. The age divisions are 0-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-15, and 16+.</p>

      <h2>Individual Events</h2>
      <p>The main individual events are solo, 2-baton, 3-baton, strut, and rhythmic twirl.

      Solo, 2-baton, and 3-baton are meant to showcase twirlers' technical skills. Solos are 2:30 minutes long, and 2-baton and 3-baton routines are 2:00 minutes long. These routines will incorporate high toss tricks, low flips/contact material, and rolls, and the routines are judged on how well twirlers execute the tricks, if they catch the tricks, and how good their bodywork and presentation are. These routines are not performed to a specific song, so typically, there will just be upbeat music playing while these events are happening.

      Strut is unique in that twirlers are not allowed to throw their batons; they have to manipulate the batons in other ways without releasing it. This routine is performed to marching music (think John Philip Sousa) and emphasizes the twirler's ability to keep in tempo and perform dance bodywork.

      Rhythmic twirl is an event where twirlers get to use their own music and choreograph their routine to a song of their choosing. This routine uses the entire floor and incorporates aspects of strut and solo. It's about musicality and performance as well as technical ability.</p>

      <h2>Team Events</h2>
      <p>Teams compete to their own music, typically with up to 8 people. There are also Corps events that have many more people and can also incorporate props besides batons.</p>

      <h2>Twirling Organizations</h2>
      <p>The two main organizations in baton twirling are NBTA (National Baton Twirling Association) and USTA (United States Twirling Association). Other well-known organizations are WTA (World Twirling Association), DMA (Drum Majorettes of America), and TU (Twirling Unlimited); they have smaller followings than NBTA and USTA.

      One of the defining differences between the organizations is that NBTA does not allow gymnastics, whereas USTA does. NBTA has longer time-limits allotted for their routines than USTA does. NBTA also places more emphasis on catching the baton, whereas USTA places more emphasis on the difficulty of the trick attempted.
